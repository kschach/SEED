## Access to Benefits

#VSLIDE

###The Problem
- Many welfare state income transfers are targeted to residents living on low incomes.<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Low-income community members face systemic barriers that can prevent access to these entitlements (Shillington 2011).<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Lack of access can have severe, negative impacts for those without adequate income prior to government transfers (social and financial exclusion, social determinants of health).<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

#VSLIDE

###The Remedy: Supported Access
- Government agencies, nonprofit organizations, and the private sector each have a role to play in connecting community members to benefits<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Nonprofit organizations are well-positioned to support vulnerable community members<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

- How can it be attained?<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

#VSLIDE

### Fraser (1997)
- Injustice: socioeconomic and sociocultural<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Remedies: redistribution and recognition<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Strategies: affirmation and transformation<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

#VSLIDE
### Key Question
- Which strategies are employed by A to B (affirmation / transformation)?

#HSLIDE
## Socioeconomic Justice through the Welfare State
- Is the welfare state an effective lever for social justice?<!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 

#VSLIDE
### Marshall (1949) - Social Citizenship
- Normative statement for social citizenship through the welfare state<!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 
- "the right to a modicum of economic welfare and security" (1950:11)<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- "the right to share to the full in the social heritage and to live
the life of a civilised being according to the standards prevailing in the society" (1950:11)<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

#VSLIDE
### Liberal Welfare State
- Does not grant and protect the rights of social citizenship<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Poor laws / principle of "less eligibility" (Piven and Cloward 1993:34-35)<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Measures of last resort rather than rights<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

#VSLIDE
### Welfare State as Social Control (Piven and Cloward 1993)
- Welfare state function: to regulate the supply of labour<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Expansion in response to political turmoil rather than social need<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Contraction once order and conditions for accumulation are restored<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

#VSLIDE
### Inequalities within the Welfare State
- Fiscal welfare vs. social welfare (Abramovitz 1983/2001; Titmuss 1965).<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Social insurance vs. social assistance (Olsen 2002; Gordon 1994)<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- The latter are:<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
    - Less generous<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
    - More controlling<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
    - Stigmatized in public discourse<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

#VSLIDE
### Axes of Inequality
- Gender (Gordon 1994; Piven and Cloward 1993; Abramovitz 1988; Morgen, Acker, and Weigt 2009)<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- 'Race' and ethnicity (Piven and Cloward 1993; Quadagno 1994)<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Indigeneity (MacDonald 2011)<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Citizenship status and duration of residency<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

## Socioeconomic Justice through the Shadow State
- Is government and philanthropic investment in non-profit social service provision a promising strategy for increasing access to benefits by financially vulnerable community members?<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- What are the benefits and drawbacks of this model?<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

#VSLIDE
### Key Concepts
- "third-party government" (Salamon 1995)<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- "hollow state" (Milward 1994)<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- "offloading" / "devolution"<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

#VSLIDE
### Potential Benefits
- Increased availability of social welfare programs and services<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Greater opportunities for local control and participation in social services<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Flexibility to adapt local conditions<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

#VSLIDE
### Potential Drawbacks
- "philanthropic insufficiency" (Salamon 1995)<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
    - Non-profit sector has marginal reach and capacity compared to the state<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
    - Problems with securing funding without recourse to taxation (via government contracts, philanthropic funding, business activities, user fees)<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

#VSLIDE
### Potential Drawbacks
- "philanthropic paternalism" (Salamon 1995)<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
    - May need to tailor programs to match donor and government priorities rather than local needs<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- "philanthropic particularism" (Salamon 1995)<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
    - No universal mandate<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
    - Can cater to particular demographics, specific geographic areas<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

#VSLIDE
### Shadow State (Wolch 1989:201)
*a para-state apparatus with collective service responsibilities previously shouldered by the public sector, administered outside democratic politics, but yet controlled in both formal and informal ways by the state.*<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

#VSLIDE
### Implications for Access to Benefit programs
- Potential benefits:<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
    - cross-sectoral partnerships that leverage the comparative advantages of each sector in service of a common good ("collective impact")<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
    - solving the "last mile" problem (Prosper Canada)<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

#VSLIDE
### Implications for Access to Benefit programs
- Hazards of devolution:<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
    - Could result in reduction in the status of benefits: from entitlement to charitable aid (Wolch 1989; Roy 2004) <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

## Key Question
- How does our position as a "shadow state" agency expand / constrain our options?<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

#VSLIDE
## Results
- Increased access to welfare<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- No guaranteed annual income<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
