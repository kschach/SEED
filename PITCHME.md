## Access to Benefits

#VSLIDE

### The Problem: Benefit Inaccessibility
- Many welfare state income transfers are targeted to residents living on low incomes<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Low-income community members face systemic barriers that can prevent access to these entitlements (Shillington 2011)<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Lack of access can have severe, negative impacts for those without adequate income prior to government transfers<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Note:

- Social and financial exclusion
- Social determinants of health

#VSLIDE

### The Remedy: Supported Access
- Government agencies, nonprofit organizations, and the private sector each have a role to play in connecting community members to benefits<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Nonprofit organizations can support vulnerable community members to access benefits<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

## Things I've Been Thinking About

Note: Not ready to share results at this stage, but can speak to some of the issues I'm considering.

#HSLIDE

### Access to Benefits and Socioeconomic Justice
- What is socioeconomic justice?<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- How can it be attained?<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

#VSLIDE

### Fraser (1997)
- Injustice: socioeconomic and sociocultural<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Remedies: redistribution and recognition<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Strategies: affirmation and transformation<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

#VSLIDE
### Key Questions
- Which activities are affirmative?<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Which activities are transformative?<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Note: 

In looking at the program model...

#HSLIDE

### Income Transfers and Socioeconomic Justice
- How do government income transfers contribute to socioeconomic justice?<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

#VSLIDE
### Social Welfare and Fiscal Welfare
- Titmuss (1965)<!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 
- Abramovitz (1983/2001)<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

#VSLIDE
**Social welfare**
- Income transfers outside of the tax system<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Stigmatized<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Less generous<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- More controlling<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Subject to caseworker discretion / "street-level bureaucracy" (Lipsky 1980)<!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 

#VSLIDE
**Fiscal Welfare**
- More generous<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Inequitable distribution<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Barriers to access (requires tax filing)<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

#VSLIDE
### Key Question
- How does the division between social and fiscal welfare affect nonprofit access to benefits programs?<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

#VSLIDE 

### Criteria for Effective Poverty Relief 
- Behrendt (2002)<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Barr (2012)<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

#VSLIDE 

### Criteria for Effective Poverty Relief 
- Benefit adequacy<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Appropriate eligibility criteria<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Actual take-up by target population<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

#VSLIDE
### Key Questions
- Which of these issues do nonprofits address?<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- ...and how?<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

#HSLIDE

### The Role of the State in Ensuring Access to Benefits

#VSLIDE
### Ebb and Flow of State Investment

#VSLIDE
### Withdrawal
- Closure of in-person Tax Services Offices by Canada Revenue Agency<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Scaleback of Community Volunteer Income Tax Program (CVITP) coordination and supports<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

#VSLIDE
### Investment
- Minister of National Revenue mandate letter (2015): Canada Revenue Agency should support low-income Canadians to file tax returns and access benefits<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Increase in Canada Revenue Agency supports to community members and service providers<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Federal and Provincial investment in nonprofit access to benefits programs<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

#VSLIDE
### Key Question
- What does government investment in nonprofit access to benefits programs signify?<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

#VSLIDE
**Strategic Partnership**<!--.element: class="fragment" --> 
- leveraging the comparative advantages of each sector in service of a common good<!--.element: class="fragment" --> 
- solving the "last mile" problem for vulnerable communities (Prosper Canada)<!--.element: class="fragment" -->

#VSLIDE
**Disentitlement**<!--.element: class="fragment" --> 
- Bureaucratic disentitlement (Lipsky 1984)<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- A reduction in the status of benefits: from entitlement to charitable aid (Wolch 1989; Roy 2004) <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

#VSLIDE

### Nonprofit Social Service Provision

#VSLIDE
### Potential Benefits
- Increased availability of social welfare programs and services<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Greater opportunities for local control and participation in social services<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Flexibility to adapt local conditions<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

#VSLIDE
### Potential Drawbacks
- "philanthropic insufficiency" (Salamon 1995)
    - Non-profit sector has marginal reach and capacity compared to the state<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
    - Problems with securing funding without recourse to taxation (via government contracts, charitable funding, business activities, user fees)<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

#VSLIDE
### Potential Drawbacks
- "philanthropic paternalism" (Salamon 1995)
    - May need to tailor programs to match donor and government priorities rather than local needs<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

#VSLIDE
### Potential Drawbacks
- "philanthropic particularism" (Salamon 1995)
    - No universal mandate<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
    - Can cater to particular demographics, specific geographic areas<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

#VSLIDE
### Potential Drawbacks
- functioning as a "shadow state" (Wolch 1989)
@quote[a para-state apparatus with collective service responsibilities previously shouldered by the public sector, administered outside democratic politics, but yet controlled in both formal and informal ways by the state.](Wolch 1989:201)<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

#VSLIDE
### Key Questions
- How can nonprofit access to benefits programs contribute to redistribution given these structural constraints?<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- How can nonprofit access to benefits programs connect social service delivery with social change efforts?<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
